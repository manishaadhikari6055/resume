Commit: A snapshot of project files.
Branch: A parallel version of the repository.
Merge: Combining changes from different branches.
Clone: Creating a local copy of a repository.
Push: Sending local changes to a remote repository.
Pull: Fetching and merging changes from a remote repository.
GitHub Pages
